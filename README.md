CiteProc
========
CiteProc is a cite processor interface and citation data API based on the
Citation Style Language (CSL) specifications. To actually process citations
a dedicated processor engine is required; these can be installed as separate
gems.

### A word of caution
As work on this and on the related packages is still in progress, please
be aware of the following caveats: the 0.0.x branch of citeproc-ruby is still
a standalone package and will conflict with this release of citeproc; support
will be added in future versions of the 1.x.x branch.
