CiteProc
========
The CiteProc gem is a Ruby abstraction layer for the JSON API used by
citeproc-js. To process citations you also require a dedicate processor engine
available as a separate gem: these will include citeproc-js, citeproc-ruby and
eventually citeproc-hs. As work on these packages is still in progress, please
be aware of the following caveats: the 0.0.x branch of citeproc-ruby is still
a standalone package and will conflict with this release of citeproc; support
will be added in future versions of the 1.x.x branch.
